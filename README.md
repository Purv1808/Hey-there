# Hey-there
My first repository on GitHub.
Currently, I am pursuing a Cyber Security program.

I am a detail-oriented and curious learner with a deep interest in cybersecurity, especially in understanding how real-world cyber threats impact both individuals and organizations. My core values—integrity, accountability, and continuous improvement—guide my approach to learning and problem-solving. As I develop technical skills like network security and threat analysis, I aim to support organizations in protecting sensitive data, building trust with users, and achieving stronger overall cyber resilience in today’s evolving digital environment.
